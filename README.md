### The High-Availability Solution to a Problem That Doesn't Exist.

**Hypermind** is a completely decentralized, Peer-to-Peer deployment counter and ephemeral chat platform.

It solves the critical infrastructure challenge of knowing exactly how many other people are currently wasting ~~50MB of~~ RAM running this specific container, while providing a secure, serverless way to say "hello" to them.

---

## What is this?

You need a service that:

1.  **Does absolutely nothing useful.**
2.  **Uses "Decentralized" and "P2P" in the description.**
3.  **Makes a number go up on a screen.**

**Enter Hypermind.**

There is no central server. There is no database. There is only **The Swarm**.

## How it works

We utilize the **Hyperswarm** DHT (Distributed Hash Table) to create a mesh network of useless nodes.

1.  **Discovery:** Your node screams into the digital void to find friends.
2.  **Gossip:** Nodes connect and whisper "I exist" to each other.
3.  **State:**
    *   **Active Count:** Maintained via a distributed LRU cache of peers seen in the last 45 seconds.
    *   **Total History:** Uses a **HyperLogLog** probabilistic data structure to estimate total unique peers with >98% accuracy.
4.  **Chaos:** Connections are rotated every 5 minutes to ensure a dynamic, unblockable topology.

## Features

### 1. The Counter
It counts. That's the main thing.
*   **Active Nodes:** Real-time count of currently online peers.
*   **Total Unique:** A probabilistic estimate of every unique node ever encountered.

### 2. Ephemeral Chat
A completely decentralized chat system built directly on top of the swarm topology.
*   **Modes:** Local (direct neighbors) and Global (gossip relay).
*   **Ephemeral:** No database. No history.
*   **Markdown:** Full support for rich text.

### 3. Visualizations
*   **Particle Map:** Visualizes approximate peer locations (if enabled).
*   **Themes:** Built-in theme switcher (Nord, Solarized, Tokyo Night, etc).<br>

## Usage

### Dashboard
Open `http://localhost:3000`. The dashboard updates in **Realtime** via Server-Sent Events.

### Chat Commands
*   `/help` - Show all commands.
*   `/local <msg>` - Send message only to direct connections.
*   `/whisper <user> <msg>` - Send a private message.
*   `/block <user>` - Block a user.
*   **Easter Eggs:** `/shrug`, `/tableflip`, `/heart`, and more.

<summary><strong>Deployment</strong></summary>

### Docker


```bash
docker run -d \
  --name hypermind \
  --network host \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  -e ENABLE_CHAT=true \
  -e ENABLE_MAP=true \
  ghcr.io/lklynet/hypermind:latest
```

> **⚠️ CRITICAL NETWORK NOTE:**
> Use `--network host`. This is a P2P application that needs to punch through NATs. If you bridge it, the DHT usually fails, and you will be the loneliest node in the multiverse.

### Docker Compose (The Classy Way)

Add this to your `docker-compose.yml` to permanently reserve system resources for no reason:

```yaml
services:
  hypermind:
    image: ghcr.io/lklynet/hypermind:latest
    container_name: hypermind
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PORT=3000
      - ENABLE_CHAT=true
      - ENABLE_MAP=true
```

### Kubernetes (The Enterprise Way)

For when you need your useless counter to be orchestrated by a control plane.

```bash
kubectl create deployment hypermind --image=ghcr.io/lklynet/hypermind:latest --port=3000
kubectl set env deployment/hypermind PORT=3000 ENABLE_CHAT=true
kubectl expose deployment hypermind --type=LoadBalancer --port=3000 --target-port=3000
```

<summary><strong>Environment Variables</strong></summary>

Hypermind is highly configurable. Use these variables to tune your experience.

### Feature Flags

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ENABLE_CHAT` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable the P2P chat system. |
| `ENABLE_MAP` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable the map visualization. |
| `ENABLE_THEMES` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable the theme switcher. |
| `VISUAL_LIMIT` | `500` | Max number of particles to render on the dashboard. |

### Network Tuning

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | The web dashboard port. |
| `MAX_PEERS` | `50000` | Max peers to track in LRU cache. |
| `MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `15` | Max active TCP/UTP connections. |
| `MAX_RELAY_HOPS` | `5` | How far a global chat message travels (TTL). |
| `PEER_TIMEOUT` | `45000` | ms before a silent peer is considered offline. |

<summary><strong>Integrations</strong></summary>

The community has bravely stepped up to integrate Hypermind into critical monitoring infrastructure.

### Home Assistant

Do you want your living room lights to turn red when the swarm grows? Of course you do.

The [Hypermind HA Integration](https://github.com/synssins/hypermind-ha) (installable via HACS) provides:

*   **RGB Control:** 0 nodes = Green. 10,000 nodes = Red.
*   **Sensors:** Swarm health checks and statistics logging.
*   **WLED Support:** Visualize the swarm size on a literal LED strip.

### Homepage Dashboard

If it's not on your dashboard, does it even exist? You can query the `/api/stats` endpoint to add a widget to [gethomepage/homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/).

Add this to your `services.yaml`:

```yaml
- Hypermind:
    icon: /icons/hypermind2.png
    href: http://<YOUR_IP>:3000
    widget:
      type: customapi
      url: http://<YOUR_IP>:3000/api/stats
      method: GET
      mappings:
        - field: count
          label: Active
        - field: totalUnique
          label: All Time
```

To get the icon to work, you have to add the icon to `/app/public/icons`. See detailed [instructions](https://gethomepage.dev/configs/services/#icons).


### API Documentation

For developers who are not satisfied in just looking a number on the screen but are craving to add new features, a comprehensive development API documentation is available in [`devdocs/API.md`](devdocs/API.md).

**Available Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/stats` - Current node statistics
- `POST /api/chat` - Send P2P chat messages
- `GET /api/github/latest-release` - Latest release information
- `GET /events` - Server-Sent Events stream for real-time updates
- `GET /js/lists.js` - Dynamic adjectives/nouns for screenname generation
- `GET /js/screenname.js` - Screenname generation logic
- `GET /` - Main HTML page

The documentation includes security best practices, rate limiting guidelines, modular route structure, and examples for creating new endpoints.

<summary><strong>Local Development</strong></summary>

Want to contribute? Why? It already does nothing perfectly. But here is how anyway:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the beast
npm start
```

### Simulating a Swarm
You can run multiple instances locally to simulate popularity:

```bash
# Terminal 1
PORT=3000 npm start

# Terminal 2
PORT=3001 npm start
```

They will discover each other via the local network DHT, and the number will become `2`. Dopamine achieved.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this crypto mining?**
A: No. We respect your GPU too much.

**Q: Does this store data?**
A: No. It has the short-term working memory of a honeybee (approx. 45 seconds).

**Q: Why did you make this?**
A: The homelab must grow. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
