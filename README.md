### The High-Availability Solution to a Problem That Doesn't Exist.

**Hypermind** is a completely decentralized, Peer-to-Peer deployment counter.

It solves the critical infrastructure challenge of knowing exactly how many other people are currently wasting 50MB of RAM running this specific container.

---

## » What is this?

You have a server rack in your basement. You have 128GB of RAM. You have deployed the Arr stack, Home Assistant, Pi-hole, and a dashboard to monitor them all. **But you crave more.**

You need a service that:

1. Does absolutely nothing useful.
2. Uses "Decentralized" and "P2P" in the description.
3. Makes a number go up on a screen.

**Enter Hypermind.**

There is no central server. There is no database. There is only **The Swarm**.

## » How it works

We utilize the **Hyperswarm** DHT (Distributed Hash Table) to achieve a singular, trivial goal of **Counting.**

1. **Discovery:** Your node screams into the digital void (`hypermind-lklynet-v1`) to find friends.
2. **Gossip:** Nodes connect and whisper "I exist" to each other.
3. **Consensus:** Each node maintains a list of peers seen in the last 2.5 seconds.

If you turn your container off, you vanish from the count. If everyone turns it off, the network ceases to exist. If you turn it back on, you are the Creator of the Universe (Population: 1).

## » Deployment

### Docker (The Fast Way)

Since you're probably pasting this into Portainer anyway:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name hypermind \
  --network host \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  ghcr.io/lklynet/hypermind:latest

```

> **⚠️ CRITICAL NETWORK NOTE:**
> Use `--network host`. This is a P2P application that needs to punch through NATs. If you bridge it, the DHT usually fails, and you will be the loneliest node in the multiverse.

### Docker Compose (The Classy Way)

Add this to your `docker-compose.yml` to permanently reserve system resources for no reason:

```yaml
services:
  hypermind:
    image: ghcr.io/lklynet/hypermind:latest
    container_name: hypermind
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PORT=3000

```

### Kubernetes (The Enterprise Way)

For when you need your useless counter to be orchestrated by a control plane.

```bash
kubectl create deployment hypermind --image=ghcr.io/lklynet/hypermind:latest --port=3000
kubectl set env deployment/hypermind PORT=3000
kubectl expose deployment hypermind --type=LoadBalancer --port=3000 --target-port=3000

```

## » Ecosystem & Integrations

The community has bravely stepped up to integrate Hypermind into critical monitoring infrastructure.

### Home Assistant

Do you want your living room lights to turn red when the swarm grows? Of course you do.

The [Hypermind HA Integration](https://github.com/synssins/hypermind-ha) (installable via HACS) provides:

* **RGB Control:** 0 nodes = Green. 10,000 nodes = Red.
* **Sensors:** Swarm health checks and statistics logging.
* **WLED Support:** Visualize the swarm size on a literal LED strip.

### Homepage Dashboard

If it's not on your dashboard, does it even exist? You can query the `/api/stats` endpoint to add a widget to [gethomepage/homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/).

Add this to your `services.yaml`:

```yaml
- Hypermind:
    icon: /icons/hypermind2.png
    href: http://<YOUR_IP>:3000
    widget:
      type: customapi
      url: http://<YOUR_IP>:3000/api/stats
      method: GET
      mappings:
        - field: count
          label: Swarm Size
        - field: direct
          label: Friends

```

## » Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | The port the web dashboard listens on. Since `--network host` is used, this port opens directly on the host. |
| `MAX_PEERS` | `10000` | Maximum number of peers to track in the swarm. Unless you're expecting the entire internet to join, the default is probably fine. |
| `ENABLE_CHAT` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable the ephemeral P2P chat terminal. |

## » Features

### 1. The Counter
It counts. That's the main thing.

### 2. Ephemeral Chat
**New:** A completely decentralized, ephemeral chat system built directly on top of the swarm topology.

* **Ephemeral:** No database. No history. If you refresh, it's gone.
* **Restricted:** You can only talk to your ~32 direct connections.
* **Chaotic:** Every 30 seconds, the network rotates your connections. You might be mid-sentence and—*poof*—your audience changes.
* **Anonymous:** You are identified only by the last 4 characters of your node ID.

To enable this feature, set `ENABLE_CHAT=true`.

## » Usage

Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`

The dashboard updates in **Realtime** via Server-Sent Events.

**You will see:**

* **Active Nodes:** The total number of people currently running this joke.
* **Direct Connections:** The number of peers your node is actually holding hands with.

## » Local Development

Want to contribute? Why? It already does nothing perfectly. But here is how anyway:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the beast
npm start

```

### Simulating Friends (Local Testing)

You can run multiple instances locally to simulate popularity:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (You)
PORT=3000 npm start

# Terminal 2 (Your imaginary friend)
PORT=3001 npm start

```

They should discover each other, and the number will become `2`. Dopamine achieved.

### FAQ

**Q: Is this crypto mining?**
A: No. We respect your GPU too much.

**Q: Does this store data?**
A: No. It has the short-term working memory of a honeybee (approx. 2.5 seconds). Which is biologically accurate and thematically consistent.

**Q: Why did you make this?**
A: The homelab must grow. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
