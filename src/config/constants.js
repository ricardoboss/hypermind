/**
 * fccview here, frankly I don't think I can make this more secure, we can change it to `00000` but
 * that means until everyone upgrade there'll be a divide between nodes.
 *
 * I ran it that way and I was fairly isolated, with hundreds of failed POW, shame.
 * adding an extra 0 makes it very expensive on attacker to make it worth the fun for them, so maybe consider it.
 * ----
 * ricardoboss: added a way to get the best of both worlds: newer nodes will use a harder POW, making them compatible
 * with others who use a harder POW while still being able to accept "old" POWs from clients
